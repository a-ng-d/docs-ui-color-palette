# Sync a color palette to the local library

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## <i class="fa-lock">:lock:</i> Sync to the local style

The shades/tints are grouped by source colors, from the darkest to the lightest. If any `Color modes` have been created, the groups will be gathered and named with their related color mode. In addition, if the palette has a custom name, every group is gathered into one with the palette name.

Once the palette is ready, click the `Sync with the local styles` button to add every color shade/tint to the document's local styles. The dark color is generated by using and inverting the base color, through the selected color space.

If you update the palette after adding its shades/tints to the local styles, you can click the `Sync with the local styles` button to update the styles that have been edited. The synchronization is not on both sides because you cannot update your palette from the local styles.

{% hint style="info" %}
The synchronization with the local styles is not deep by default, so the styles that do not match the shade/tint of your palette will remain. Read more about the [`Preferences`](../user-management/update-your-preferences.md).
