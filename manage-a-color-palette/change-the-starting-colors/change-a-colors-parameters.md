# Change a color's parameters

You can change in real-time the name of the color and its hexadecimal code (via the color picker or the text input). You can also watch the [`LCH`](../../glossary.md#lch) values, which might be changed directly to update the color.

The number inputs copycat the Figma ones.
{% endhint %}

There are more advanced options:

* The `Hue` range can also be shifted to adjust the hue of the shades' scale (handy for the yellow colors).
* The `Chroma` range can also be shifted to adjust the saturation of the shades' scale. If adjusted, the global `Chroma` of the palette cannot override this value. If reset, the global `Chroma` value is restored.
* The description can help you organize the shades and bring semantics.
