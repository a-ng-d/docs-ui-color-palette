# Adjust the lightness and the chroma

The slider allows you to change the lightness scale in real-time. You can use the same keyboard shortcuts as the [creation](../../create-a-color-palette/set-the-lightness-scale-stops/).

The changes will be reflected in the `Preview` and the palette on the document canvas.
