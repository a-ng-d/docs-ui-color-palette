The slider allows you to change the lightness scale in real-time. Note that you can use the same keyboard shortcuts as the creation.

The `Distribution easing` drives how the stops are distributed in the range. `Linear` is the default option and allows you to bring an equivalent gap between the stops, but you can select:

* `Ease in` for a quick acceleration at the end.
* `Ease out` for a quick acceleration at the start.
* `Ease in and out` for quick acceleration at the start and the end.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can tweak a stop with more accuracy:

* Select the stop and press the arrow keys. The default nudge amount is 1%, reduced to 0.1% if the `Cmd ⌘` (macOS) or `Ctrl ⌃` (Windows) is pressed.
* Double-click the stop and change the value.

## Add or remove stops in the `Custom` preset

Click on the range to add a new stop. Select a stop, then press `Backspace ⌫` to remove it. The stops could be renamed to keep a consistent order.

{% hint style="info" %}
The adding or the removing only works in the `Custom` preset.
