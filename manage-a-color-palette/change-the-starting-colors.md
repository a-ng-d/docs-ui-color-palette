Click on the Plus icon to add a new color in the `Source colors`. There is a Minus icon at each color to remove it definitively from the palette (but it can be redone on the canvas).

{% hint style="info" %}
The default name of a new color is `New UI Color`.
{% endhint %}

You can change in real-time the name of the color and its hexadecimal code (via the color picker or the text input). You can also watch the [`LCH`](../glossary.md#lch) values, which might be changed directly to update the color.

{% hint style="info" %}
The number inputs copycat the Figma ones.
{% endhint %}

There are more advanced options:

* The hue range can also be shifted to adjust the shades' scale (handy for the yellow colors).
* The chroma range can also be shifted to adjust the shades' scale (handy for the yellow and green colors).
* The description can help you organize the shades and bring more semantics.

You can reorder the colors list by dragging an item and dropping it above or below another.

{% hint style="info" %}
The reorder copycats the Figma one.
