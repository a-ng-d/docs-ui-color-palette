# Change the themes' parameters

Select a previously created theme via the list at the top-right, and then you can change its lightness scale. By selecting another theme, the lightness scale updates and then can be adjusted with the slider.

In addition, in the `ColorsÂ themes`, you can change the following:

* Color theme name.
* Palette background color (can be darker for a dark mode).
* Color theme description (expand first by clicking the Ellipsis icon).
