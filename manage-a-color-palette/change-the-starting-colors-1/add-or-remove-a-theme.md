# Add or remove a theme

Click on the Plus icon to add a new color in the `Color themes`. Each theme has a Minus icon to remove it definitively from the palette (but it can be redone on the canvas).

{% hint style="info" %}
The default name of a new color is `New UI Theme`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can create as many color themes as you need; nevertheless, the more themes you manage, the more limits you might meet to create local variables. According to your Figma plan:

* In Figma Starter, you cannot add more than 1 variable mode.
* In Figma Professional and Organization, you cannot add more than 4 variable modes.
