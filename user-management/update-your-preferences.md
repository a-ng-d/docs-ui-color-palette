# Update your preferences

You can configure your `Preferences` in the <i class="fa-user">:user:</i> `User menu`.

There are two preferences:

* **The synchronization behavior between the palette and local styles**.\
  If enabled, the variables in the collection matching the shades/tints in the palette are updated, and every style that does not match a shade/tint is deleted. The group name will be the palette one.\
  If disabled, every style that does not match a shade/tint is preserved.
* **The synchronization behavior between the palette and local variables**.\
  If enabled, the variables in the collection matching the shades/tints in the palette are updated, and every variable that does not match a shade/tint is deleted. The collection name will be the palette one.\
  If disabled, every variable that does not match a shade/tint is preserved.
