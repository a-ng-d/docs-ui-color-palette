# Manage your licenseãƒ»/One

Once you purchase a license on the UI Color Palette store, you will receive an email with your license key. Then, you can open `Manage license` in the <i class="fa-user">:user:</i> `User menu`.

Paste your license key in the Instance key input, and type a name (you can use your first name) in order to identify the key's consumer and manage it via **Lemon Squeezy**. This may help the owner of the licenses if he has purchased them.

We can manage the license keys for each of our customers, and if you need any assistance, please let us know!
