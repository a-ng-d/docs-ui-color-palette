# UI Color Palette 26

## Improvements

### Create and Update Local Variables with a Single Click

Both actions are combined into a single button for clarity. This button creates or updates local styles and variables based on the selected palette (it does not remove them yet).

### Simplify the export file selection

In the coming weeks, we will be adding several new exports, including the Tailwind and Chakra CSS frameworks (spoiler alert!). We have enhanced the experience of selecting the appropriate format to accommodate a wider range of options.

## Minor Changes

* The highlights do not appear on the very first run.
* The NPS forms can be filled within the plugin.
* The local styles are gathered in a group named with the palette's one (if renamed).
* Review the content related to color spaces and settings.

## Bug fixes

* The variable "description" is equivalent to the source color, preventing constant updates even if nothing has been edited.
