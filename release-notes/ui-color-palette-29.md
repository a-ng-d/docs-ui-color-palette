## Key Feature

This feature enables direct exporting of your work to Tailwind. It simplifies the design process by reducing the steps needed to incorporate your designs into Tailwind projects, saving time and increasing workflow efficiency.

We've also integrated a Tailwind preset, providing more options for your designs. This addition lets you apply Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework to your projects, enhancing design flexibility.
