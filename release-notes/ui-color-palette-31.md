We've introduced a feature that allows users to import from Realtime Colors. This addition streamlines the process of incorporating color variations into their color references document and scaling them to a color system.

## Minor Changes

* A new feature allows users to specify various types of color blindness, enhancing design accessibility.
* A dual-action button has been added, providing more functionality and control.
* Users can now reorder their shortcuts, aiding efficiency and productivity.
* We've enabled export to HSL, for work in the HSL color model.
* The code zone's scroll resets after a format change, ensuring users start at the top.

## Bug Fixes
