## Color spaces gamuts

<details>

<summary>sRGB</summary>

The sRGB gamut is a color space standard used in monitors, printers, and the internet. It defines a range of colors for accurate and consistent display. It is widely accepted and compatible with existing technologies.

<summary>P3</summary>

The P3 gamut is a color space that has more colors than sRGB and is used in high-end displays like Apple's Retina. It displays vibrant and accurate colors in movies, photos, and visual content.

<details>

<summary>D65</summary>

The D65 color space gamut is used in photography, printing, and video. It's based on CIE 1931, with a wide range of colors. D65 white point is daylight's average color, preferred for calibration. Its gamut allows for accurate and vibrant color reproduction, which is useful for visual arts professionals.

## Color spaces models

<details>

<summary>CIELAB</summary>

CIELAB is a color space model based on human perception. It includes Lightness (L), red-green (A\* axis), and yellow-blue (B\* axis) attributes. It's used in printing, textiles, and painting for accurate color reproduction.

</details>

<details>

<summary>HSL</summary>

The HSL color space model is a type of color space commonly used in graphic design and web development. It has three axes, two of which represent Saturation (S\* axis) and Lightness (L\* axis), while the other represents Hue (H\* axis). The hue axis is circular, which enables a full range of colors to be displayed.

<summary>HSLuv</summary>

The HSLuv color space model works similarly with [HSL](glossary.md#hsl) but with improved perceptual uniformity and a more comprehensive range of chroma values. The chroma in HSLuv is adaptive and changes depending on the lightness value, providing a more consistent and natural-looking color representation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>LCH</summary>

The LCH color space model works similarly with [HSL](glossary.md#hsl) but with improved perceptual uniformity and a more comprehensive range of chroma values. The chroma in LCH is adaptive and changes depending on the lightness value, providing a more consistent and natural-looking color representation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>OKLAB</summary>

The OKLAB color space is a popular model for digital media that provides consistent results across devices and platforms. It's based on [CIELAB](glossary.md#cielab) and closely matches human vision, making it useful for image processing and color grading.

</details>

<details>

<summary>OKLCH</summary>

The OKLCH color space model is a highly accurate color space that utilizes two Chroma (C\* axis) and Lightness (L\* axis) axes and one Hue rotation (H\* axis), surpassing the accuracy of the [LCH](glossary.md#lch) color space model. It allows for precise color representation and is commonly used in color management applications.

<summary>RGB</summary>

Computers and TVs use RGB color space with primary red, green, and blue colors. Other colors are created by changing their intensity. RGB is popular in digital imaging and graphic design.
