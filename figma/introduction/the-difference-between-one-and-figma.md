# The difference between /one and /figma

UI Color Palette is divided into two plugins, sharing the same features but with a different transactional workflow.

## UI Color Palette /one

This plugin offers Pro features accessible via a license-based system. With a single license, you can use these Pro features on any platform ([Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Penpot](https://penpot.app/)) where the plugin is available. Licenses are managed by the third-party system [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/), with oversight from the UI Color Palette team. For assistance, please contact our support team.

## UI Color Palette /figma

{% hint style="info" %}
Figma is unable to accept payments from users with **Russian** or **Indian**-based credit cards at this time.
{% endhint %}

The plugin offers Pro features accessible through Figma's own transactional system, but these features are only usable within Figma.  Once purchased, you can [manage your subscription](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/29316602010775-Cancel-or-renew-a-plugin-subscription) directly on Figma. There's no need to contact us because we can manage your subscription.
