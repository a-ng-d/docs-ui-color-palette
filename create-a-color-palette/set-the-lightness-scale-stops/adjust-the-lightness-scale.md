# Adjust the lightness scale

Update a stop by sliding its knob on the range. You can slide every knob by using these shortcuts:

* `Cmd ⌘` (macOS) or `Ctrl ⌃` (Windows) while sliding any knob to move each of them in the desired direction.
* `Shift ⇪` while sliding the first or the last stop to distribute each of them equally on the range.

In addition, you can adjust the `Chroma` of every scaled color from 0% (unsaturated) to 200% (oversaturated).

You can tweak a stop with more accuracy:

* Select the stop and press the arrow keys. The default nudge amount is 1%, decreased to 0.1% if the `Cmd ⌘` (macOS) or `Ctrl ⌃` (Windows).
* Double-click the stop and change the value.
