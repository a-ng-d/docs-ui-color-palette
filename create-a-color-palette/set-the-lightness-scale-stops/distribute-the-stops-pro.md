# Distribute the stopsãƒ»Pro

{% hint style="danger" %}
Setting the `Distribution easing` is only available on the <mark style="color:yellow;">`Pro`</mark> plan.
{% endhint %}

The `Distribution easing` drives how the stops are distributed in the range. `Linear` is the default option and allows you to bring an equivalent gap between the stops, but you can select:

* `Ease in` for a quick acceleration at the end.
* `Ease out` for a quick acceleration at the start.
* `Ease in and out` for quick acceleration at the start and the end.

The easings are varied in three ways:

* `Sine`.
* `Regular`.
* `Cubic`.
