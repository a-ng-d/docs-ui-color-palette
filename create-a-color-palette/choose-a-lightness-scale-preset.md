A preset contains a list of stops named from an established nomenclature. These presets are frameworks that can help you build a color system:

* `Material Design`, 10 stops, from 50 to 900 (Google).
* `Material 3`, 13 stops, from 0 to 100 (Google).
* `Tailwind`, 11 stops, from 50 to 950 (Google)・Pro.
* `Ant Design`, 10 stops, from 1 to 10.
* `ADS Foundations` (Atlassian)・Pro:
  * 7 stops, from 50 to 500.
  * 19 stops (for neutral colors), from 0 to 900.
* `Carbon`, 10 stops, from 10 to 100 (IBM)・Pro.
* `Base`, 8 stops, from 50 to 700 (Uber)・Pro.

Or make your own from 2 to 24 stops via the `Custom` preset. The stops naming convention can be edited to meet your need, only available with this preset when creating a palette:

* `1 - 24`, the default option, increasing by 1
* `10 - 240`, increasing by 10
* `100 - 2400`, increasing by 100

{% hint style="warning" %}
Managing more than 15 stops could complicate the color system. It also depends on the number of the `Source colors`.
