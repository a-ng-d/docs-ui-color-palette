Select some filled layers to access the configuration. You might rename these layers because the palette will use the layer name as a color name.

In addition, the Pro plan allows you to import a palette from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) by pasting its URL to the required field. The colors are named by default with their hexadecimal code.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The selected layers must have a solid color as the `Fill` property.
{% endhint %}
