# Import colors from external libraries

The color combinations can be edited using tailored tools such as [`Coolors`](https://coolors.co/), [`Realtime Colors`](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=050315-fbfbfe-2f27ce-dedcff-433bff\&fonts=Inter-Inter), and [`Colour Lovers`](https://www.colourlovers.com/).&#x20;

For [`Coolors`](https://coolors.co/) and [`Realtime Colors`](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=050315-fbfbfe-2f27ce-dedcff-433bff\&fonts=Inter-Inter), you can copy the URL and paste it into the appropriate field. The URL will be parsed, and each color will be added to the source colors.

For [`Colour Lovers`](https://www.colourlovers.com/), you can browse the palettes provided by the community directly from the controller. Each palette is linked to the original one, and the author is mentioned. In case of adding, you will be redirected to the `Overview` context.
