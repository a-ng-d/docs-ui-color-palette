First, create the palette to adjust the lightness scale in real-time.
{% endhint %}

Update a stop by sliding its knob on the range. You can slide every knob by using these shortcuts:

* `Cmd ⌘` (macOS) or `Ctrl ⌃` (Windows) while sliding any knob to move each of them in the desired direction.
* `Shift ⇪` while sliding the first or the last stop to distribute each of them equally on the range.

The `Distribution easing` drives how the stops are distributed in the range. `Linear` is the default option and allows you to bring an equivalent gap between the stops, but you can select:

* `Ease in` for a quick acceleration at the end.
* `Ease out` for a quick acceleration at the start.
* `Ease in and out` for quick acceleration at the start and the end.
