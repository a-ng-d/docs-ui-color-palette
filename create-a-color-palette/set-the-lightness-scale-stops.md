Update a stop by sliding its knob on the range. You can slide every knob by using these shortcuts:

* `Cmd ⌘` (macOS) or `Ctrl ⌃` (Windows) while sliding any knob to move each of them in the desired direction.
* `Shift ⇪` while sliding the first or the last stop to distribute each of them equally on the range.
