# Create color themes・Pro

{% hint style="danger" %}
Managing `Color themes` is only available in the Pro plan.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
* The default color theme is named `None`.
* The properties are hidden during the adjustment to provide good performance in editing.
{% endhint %}

## Add or remove a theme

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ef4enwl73v0fBK5rq3v2PFmnlodtxAza/view?usp=drive_link" fullWidth="true" %}

Click on the Plus icon to add a new color in the `Color themes`. Each theme has a Minus icon to remove it definitively from the palette (but it can be redone on the canvas).

{% hint style="info" %}
The default name of a new color is `New UI Theme`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can create as many color themes as you need; nevertheless, the more themes you manage, the more limits you might meet to create local variables. According to your Figma plan:

* In Figma Starter, you cannot add more than 1 variable mode.
* In Figma Professional and Organization, you cannot add more than 4 variable modes.

Learn more by consulting [Figma pricing](https://www.figma.com/pricing/).
{% endhint %}

## Change the themes' parameters

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qu2pjKtM1vrIlyDwIThGTczr4gSxSSkk/view?usp=drive_link" fullWidth="true" %}

Select a previously created theme via the list at the top-right, and then you can change its lightness scale. By selecting another theme, the lightness scale updates and then can be adjusted with the slider.

In addition, in the `Colors themes`, you can change the following:

* Color theme name.
* Palette background color (can be darker for a dark mode).
* Color theme description (expand first by clicking the Ellipsis icon).

{% hint style="info" %}
The number inputs copycat the Figma ones.
{% endhint %}

## Reorder the themes

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZZ4gv3w7ZBwWqF4M1667JIFfRtlSAtZj/view?usp=drive_link" fullWidth="true" %}

You can reorder the themes list by dragging an item and dropping it above or below another.

{% hint style="info" %}
The reorder copycats the Figma one.
{% endhint %}
