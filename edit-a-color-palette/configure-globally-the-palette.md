When you create a new palette, the improved color shade generation process is automatically used to generate every color shade from your source color. However, you'll need to manually enable this improved process for your existing palettes because it may significantly change the color shades. The improved process aims to harmonize the chroma and create a more consistent palette with slightly desaturated colors.
