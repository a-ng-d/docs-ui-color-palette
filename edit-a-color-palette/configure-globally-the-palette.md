You can change the global color space of the palette. If you select another color space, your whole palette will be affected. Fortunately, you can browse the available color spaces without impacting the configuration (scale, source colors). Here is the color spaces:

* LCH (default color space)
* OKLAB
* CIELAB
* OKLAB
* HSL

When you create a new palette, the improved color shade creation process is automatically used to create every color shade from your source color. However, you'll need to manually enable this improved process for your existing palettes because it may significantly change the color shades. The improved process aims to harmonize the chroma and create a more consistent palette with slightly desaturated colors.

## Adjust the text light and dark color

You have the option to customize the text colors used for simulating contrast between the color shade and accompanying text. This allows you to compare contrast using colors that are more relevant to your brand guidelines. While pure black `#000` and white `#FFF` are the default colors, you can now tailor them to better suit your needs.
