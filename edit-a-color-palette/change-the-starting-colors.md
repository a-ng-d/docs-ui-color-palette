You can change in real-time the name of color, and its hexadecimal code (via the color picker or the text input). You can also watch the `LCH` values, that might be changed directly to update the color.

{% hint style="info" %}
The number inputs copycat the Figma ones
{% endhint %}

There are more advanced options to get a better control. You can toggle the OKLCH space of the color on to get a deeper progression of its shades. The hue range can be also shifted to adjust more finely the shades' progression (very useful for the yellow colors).

## Reorder the colors

Click on the Plus icon to add a new color in the `Source colors`. There is a Minus icon at each color to remove it definitively from the palette (but it can be redo on the canvas).

{% hint style="info" %}
The default name of a new color is `New UI Color`
