# Sync the palette to the local styles

## Add the shades to the document's local styles

Once the palette is ready, click the `Create local styles` button to add every color shade to the document's local styles. These styles can be published in the Team Library.

The shades are grouped by source colors, from the darkest to the lightest. If any `Color themes` have been created, the groups will be gathered and named with their related color theme. In addition, if the palette has a custom name, every group is gathered into one with the palette name.

## Update the document's local styles

If you update the palette after adding its shades to the local styles, you can click the `Update the existing local styles` button to update the styles that have been edited. You must first push every shade before updating. The synchronization is not on both sides because you cannot update your palette from the local styles.

In case of editing, you should republish by hand the updated variables.
