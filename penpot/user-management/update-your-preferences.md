There is two preferences:

* **The synchronization behavior between the palette and local styles**.\
  If enabled, the variables in the collection matching the shades/tints in the palette are updated, and every style that does not match a shade/tint is deleted. The group name will be the palette one.\
  If disabled, every style that does not match a shade/tint is preserved.
* The language of the UI:
  * English (US)
  * French (France)
  * Portuguese (Brazil)
  * Chinese (Simplified)
