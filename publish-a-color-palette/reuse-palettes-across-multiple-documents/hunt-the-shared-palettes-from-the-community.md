# Hunt the shared palettes from the community

You can go to `Palettes`, then `From the community`, to retrieve a list of shared palettes provided by `UI Color Palette` Users. These palettes keep a link to their `Master` and can be synchronized if the user publishes a new version. You must click `Synchronize palette` to check the status.

From the list, you can:

* `Add to file`: A palette instance is pushed to the document. It can be updated and republished later.
* `Search palettesâ€¦`: Quickly go to a specific palette or a group of palettes.
